# VulnerabilityLifetimes Artifact for USENIX Sec'22

Paper: [pdf](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22summer_alexopoulos.pdf)
## Instructions

- Clone this repository `git clone --branch usenix_v1 https://github.com/manuelbrack/VulnerabilityLifetimes.git`.
- Change working directory to the repository `cd ./VulnerabilityLifetimes`.
- Run `./build_run_docker.sh` to build and run the docker container for the artifact (docker and superuser priviledges required). This will give you a bash prompt in the now running container. Change working directory with `cd ./VulnerabilityLifetimes`.
- To execute all operations run `./run_all.sh`. We recommend that you redirect the stdout and stderr (also) to a file so that you can make sure everything worked fine, e.g. with `./run_all.sh |& tee -a log.txt`. This is also necessary if you want to look into some results that are printed in stdout in the current version, such as statistical test results. You can also run this script in the background or detach from the docker container while you wait for the artifact to execute. Instead of executing the `run_all.sh` script you can view it and execute the commands in it one by one. Generally, the main thing that can go wrong is a problem in cloning a repository or downloading an external file (due to e.g. a server side or connectivity issue). In that case the commands in the `run_all.sh` script can be repeated.
- If everything is successful, the output will be located in the `./out` directory. Check the content of the file `./out/lifetimes_table.csv`. If the reported numbers are similar to the ones of Table 3 of the paper, then you can be confident that the code ran as expected. Copy the contents of the `./out` directory from the container to the host ([docker cp](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/)), and then to a machine with a screen so you can also view the plots. Plots are organized as follows:
    -  in the directory `./out/distributions` you can find all plots having to do with distributions (e.g. Figures 5,6 of the paper).
    -  in the directory `./out/year_trends` you can find all plots showing the progression of lifetimes over time (e.g. content of Figures 3,7,10 of the paper).
    -  in the directory `./out/regular_code_age` you can find all plots comparing vulnerability lifetimes with code age (e.g. content of Figure 9 of the paper).
